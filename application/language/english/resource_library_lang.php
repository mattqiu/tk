Business Associate shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Business Associates to participate in TPS in any manner that varies from the program as set forth in official TPS literature. Business Associates shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Customers or Business Associates to execute any agreement or contract other than official  TPS agreements and contracts in order to subscribe to or purchase  TPS  products  or services or to become TPS Business Associates. Similarly, Business Associates shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Customers or Business Associates to make any purchase from, or payment to, any individual or other entity to participate in the TPS Compensation Plan.

<h5>3.2.1 General</h5>
All Business Associates shall safeguard and promote the good reputation of TPS and its products and services. The marketing and promotion of TPS, the TPS opportunity, the Compensation Plan, and TPS products or services must avoid all discourteous, deceptive, misleading, unethical or immoral conduct or practices.<br>

To promote both the platform and the opportunity TPS has to offer, Business Associates must use the sales aids and  support materials produced  by  TPS or an  Accredited  support company bearing the TPS accreditation mark. If TPS Business Associates develop their own sales aids and promotional materials (which includes Internet advertising), notwithstanding Business Associates’ good intentions, they may unintentionally violate any number of statutes or regulations affecting the TPS business. These violations, although they may be relatively few in number, could jeopardize the

TPS opportunity for all Business Associates. Accordingly, Business Associates must submit all sales aids, promotional materials, advertisements, websites and other literature to the Company for Company’s written approval prior to use. The marketing and promotion of TPS, the TPS opportunity, the Compensation Plan, and TPS products and services shall be consistent with the public interest. Business Associates may not make false or misleading statements about the sales opportunity. Business Associates may not sell sales aids to other TPS Business Associates.  Any Business Associate who receives written authorization from TPS to produce his or her own sales aids may not sell such material to any other TPS Business Associate. TPS further reserves the right to rescind approval for any sales tools, promotional materials, advertisements, or other literature, and Business Associates waive all claims for damages or remuneration arising from or relating to such rescission.

<h5>3.2.2 Trademarks and Copyrights</h5>
The name of TPS and other names as may be adopted or used by TPS are proprietary trade names, trademarks and service marks, designs, or  symbols,  or  any  derivatives  of  such marks of TPS (collectively “marks”). As such, these marks are of great value to TPS and are supplied to Business Associates for their use only in an  expressly  authorized  manner.  TPS will not allow the use of its marks by any person, including TPS Business Associates, in any unauthorized  manner.<br>

Business Associates may not use or attempt to register any of TPS’s marks, product names, the Company’s name, or any derivative thereof, for any Internet domain name, e---mail address, or online alias. Additionally, a Business Associate cannot use or register domain names, email addresses, and/or online aliases that could cause confusion, or be misleading or deceptive, in that they cause individuals to believe or assume the communication is from, or is the property of TPS.<br>

The content of all Company sponsored events is copyrighted material. Business Associates may not produce for sale or distribution any recorded Company events, presentations, or speeches. Nor may Business Associates reproduce for sale or for personal use any recording of Company---produced audio or videotape presentations.<br><br>
As an independent Business Associate, Business Associates may use the TPS name in the following<br><br>
manner:Business Associate’s Name<br>
Independent TPS Business Associate<br><br>

Example:<br>
Martin Ramos<br>
Independent TPS Business Associate<br><br>

For example, a Business Associate may not secure a domain name such as www.JoinThePerfectSolution.com, or any domain name containing any TPS name, representation, or symbology. Similarly, a TPS Business Associate cannot create an email address such as TPS138sales@hotmail.com. Additionally, a Business Associate may only use the phrase Independent TPS Business Associate in telephone greetings or on an answering machine to clearly separate the Business Associate’s independent  TPS138 business from TPS corporate.

<h5>3.2.3 Media and Media Inquiries</h5>
No press releases may be issued by anyone other than TPS Corporate.  No exceptions.<br><br>

Business Associates must not attempt to respond to media inquiries regarding TPS, its products or services, or their independent TPS business.

Business Associates must not utilize radio or television media, including radio or television infomercials, for the purposes of advertising, distribution, or promotion of the TPS products or opportunity without the express consent of TPS138. In the unlikely event that TPS does grant permission for the use of such media, TPS reserves the right to have final authority and final approval before any releases of media, on every stage of the production process with full rights to all recordings.

<h5>3.2.4 Unsolicited Email</h5>
TPS does not permit Business Associates to send unsolicited commercial emails unless such emails strictly comply  with applicable laws  and regulations  including, without  limitation, the  federal CAN  SPAM Act.

By entering into the Business Associate Agreement, Business Associate agrees that the Company may send such emails and that the Business Associate’s physical and email addresses will be included in such emails as outlined above. Business Associates shall honor opt--- out requests generated as a result of such emails sent by the Company.
<h5>3.2.5 Unsolicited Faxes</h5>
Except as provided in this section, Business Associates may not use or transmit unsolicited faxes in connection with their TPS businesses.

<h5>3.2.6 Telephone Directory Listings</h5>
Business Associates may list themselves as an “Independent TPS Business Associate” in the white or yellow pages of the telephone directory, or with online directories, under their own name. No Business Associate may place telephone or online directory display ads using TPS's name  or  logo.  Business Associates  may  not answer the telephone by saying “TPS”, “TPS Incorporated”, or in any other manner that would lead the caller  to believe that he or she has reached corporate offices of  TPS.  If a Business Associate wishes to post his or her name in a telephone or online directory, it must be listed in the following format:<br><br>

Business Associate is Name<br>
Independent TPS Business Associate

<h5>3.2.7 Television and Radio Advertising</h5>
Business Associates may not advertise on television or radio except with TPS’s prior express written approval.

<h4>3.3 Online Conduct</h4>
It is the Business Associate’s obligation to ensure that his or her online marketing activities are truthful, are not deceptive and do not mislead Customers or potential Business Associates in any way.
<h5>3.3.1 Business Associate Web Sites</h5>
Business Associates may develop their own web pages, with prior review and written consent from the Company, however, any Business Associate who does so: (a) must use the text of the Company’s official web site; (b) may not supplement the content of his or her web site with text from any source other than the Company; and (c) may not promote or sell any non---TPS products or opportunity. Websites and web promotion activities and tactics that mislead or are deceptive, regardless of intent, will result in disciplinary action. Misleading tactics include, but are not limited to,  spam  linking  (or  blog  spam),  unethical  search engine optimization tactics, misleading click---through ads (i.e. having the display URL of a Pay---Per---Click campaign appear to be directed to an official TPS Corporate Site when it in fact goes elsewhere), deceptive or misleading banner ads, and deceptive or misleading press releases. TPS will be the sole determinant of truthfulness and whether specific activities are misleading or deceptive.<br><br>

No income claims or representations contained within a Business Associate’s website unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company and there must be a link to the TPS Income Disclosure Statement immediately adjacent to any such claim or representation.<br>
The use of any other web site or web page (including without limitation auction sites such as eBay) to promote TPS products or the TPS opportunity is prohibited.

Additionally, such  websites  must  not  contain disingenuous popup ads or promotions or malicious code.   Decisions and corrective actions in this area are at TPS’s sole discretion.

<h5>3.3.3 Independent Business Associate Disclosure</h5>
To avoid confusion, each page of a Business Associate’s website must prominently disclose that the website is owned and operated by an Independent TPS Business Associate and not by the Company. To avoid confusion the following two elements must be prominently displayed at the top of every page of an independent TPS website developed by a Business Associate:<br><br>

•The TPS independent Business Associate logo<br>
•The Business Associate’s name and title (i.e., Alice Smith, Independent TPS Business Associate)<br><br>

Anyone  landing  on  any  page  of  an  Business Associate’s  website  must  clearly  understand  that  they  are  at  an Independent Business Associate site, and not an TPS Corporate page.

<h5>3.3.4  Social Media and Digital Media</h5>
In addition to meeting all other requirements specified in these Policies and Procedures, should a Business Associate utilize any form of social media, including but not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Wechat, Pinterest, or the Business Associate agrees to each of the following:<br><br>

•No product sales or enrollments may occur on any social media site without obtaining the prior approval from TPS. To generate sales, a social media site must link only to the TPS website or subsequent shopping site;<br>
•It is each Business Associate's responsibility to follow the social media site’s terms of use. If the social media site does not allow its site to be used for commercial activity, the Business Associate must abide by the site’s terms of use; and
Any social media site that is directly or indirectly operated or controlled by a Business Associate that is used to discuss or promote TPS’s products or the TPS opportunity may not link to any website, social media site, or site of any other nature, other than the TPS website.<br>
•Social media may be used by Business Associates to share information about the TPS business opportunity and TPS services, provided such information complies with the terms of the Agreement. Profiles a Business Associate generates in any social community where TPS is discussed or mentioned must clearly identify the Business Associate as an Independent TPS Business Associate and not as an employee, agent, or corporate representative of the Company. Business Associates may not upload, submit or publish any content to (including but not limited to) Facebook, YouTube, Wechat, Twitter or Pinterest any video, audio, presentations or any computer files received from TPS or captured at official TPS events or in buildings owned or operated by TPS. No income claims or representations may be made when participating in a social networking site unless expressly approved in writing by the Company. <br><br>

TPS takes no responsibility for members who choose sell products on ebay, amazon or any other online shopping or auction site. TPS members may do so with the understanding that they if they utilize these platforms to sell products, then they are selling at their own risk. TPS is not responsible for any loss or situation the may arise from the use of these external sites.
<br><br>

Business Associates may not use online classifieds (including Craigslist) to list, sell, or retail  specific  TPS products and  services  or  the  business  opportunity.  TPS products  and  services may not be listed on Amazon, eBay or any other online auction sites. Nor may Business Associate’s enlist or allow a third party to sell products on Amazon, eBay or any other online auction sites.
<h5>3.3.5 Authorization to Use Name and Likeness</h5>
By executing the Agreement, each Business Associate grants to the Company and its Business Associates and agents the absolute, perpetual and worldwide right and license to use, to record, photograph, publish, reproduce, advertise, display, edit, and sell in any manner for all purposes, his or her name, photograph, likeness, voice testimony, biographical information, image and other information related to Business Associate’s business with the Company (collectively the  “Likeness”)  in  marketing,  promotional,  advertising  and  training  materials, whether in print, radio or television broadcasts (including cable and satellite transmissions) audio and videotapes on the Internet or in other media (“Publicity Materials”) for  an  unlimited  number  of  times, without compensation, in perpetuity. Each Business Associate waives any right to inspect or approve any Publicity Materials including or accompanying his or her Likeness. Each Business Associate further releases the Company from any liability or obligation  that may  arise as  a result of the  use of his  or her Likeness, including  without limitation, claims for invasion of privacy, infringement of right of publicity and defamation (including libel and slander). A Business Associate may withdraw his or her authorization of any use of his or her Likeness that has not already been publicized by providing written notice to the Company. Business Associates agree that any information given by Business Associate, including his or her testimonial, is true and accurate.
<h4>3.4  Change of Sponsor</h4>
A Business Associate may only have one sponsor. Except as set forth in this Section, TPS prohibits changes of sponsorship to uphold the integrity of the Commission Plan and downline.

<h5>3.4.1 Cancellation and Re-­-application</h5>
A Business Associate may only change his or her Sponsor by voluntarily terminating his or her Business Associate Agreement and remaining inactive (i.e., no promotion or sponsor of sales of TPS products or services, no sponsoring, no attendance at any TPS functions, no participation in  any  other  form  of Business Associate activity, no operation of any other TPS business, and no income from the TPS business) for six full calendar months after termination. Following the six month  period  of inactivity, the former Business Associate may reapply under a new Sponsor. In that event,  the  former  Business Associate’s Marketing Organization will remain in the original line of sponsorship and the former Business Associate will start back as a new Business Associate with no downline.
<h4>3.5 Waiver of Claims</h4>
In cases in which the appropriate sponsorship change procedures have not been followed, and a Marketing Organization has been developed in the second business developed by a Business Associate,  TPS reserves the sole and exclusive right to determine the final disposition of the Marketing Organization. Resolving conflicts over the proper placement of a downline that has developed under  a Marketing Organization that has improperly switched sponsors is often extremely difficult. Therefore, BUSINESS ASSOCIATES WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST TPS, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS, OWNERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS  THAT  RELATE  TO  OR  ARISE  FROM TPS’S DECISION REGARDING THE TRANSFER OR DISPOSITION OF ANY DOWNLINE OR MARKETING  ORGANIZATION.
<h4>3.6 Unauthorized Claims and Actions SECTION</h4>
<h5>3.6.1 Indemnification</h5>
A Business Associate is fully responsible for all of his or her verbal and written statements made regarding TPS services and the Compensation Plan, which are not expressly contained, in official TPS materials. This includes statements and representations made through all sources of communication media, whether person---to---person, in meetings, online, through Social Media, in print, or any other means of communication. By accepting the Agreement, each Business Associate agrees to indemnify and hold harmless  the Company, its owners, officers, directors, employees, agents  and successors in interest from and against any claim, demand, liability, loss, cost or expense including, but not limited to, court costs and attorneys’ fees, asserted against or suffered or incurred by any of them, directly or indirectly, arising out of or in any way related to or connected with allegedly or otherwise, the Business Associate’s (i) activities as a Business Associate; (ii) breach of the terms of the Agreement; and/or (iii) violation of or failure to comply with any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation. This provision shall survive the  termination  of  the Business Associate  Agreement.
<h5>3.6.2  Income Claims</h5>
A Business Associate, when presenting or discussing the TPS opportunity or Compensation Plan to a prospective Business Associate, may not make income projections, income claims, or disclose his or her TPS income (including the showing of checks, copies of checks, bank statements, or tax records) unless previously approved in writing by the Company and, at the time the presentation  is  made,  the  Business Associate provides a current copy of the TPS Income Disclosure Statement (IDS) to the person(s) to whom he or she is making the presentation.
<h5>3.6.3 Opportunity Claims</h5>
When presenting or discussing the TPS opportunity or the TPS Compensation Plan, Business Associates must make it clear to prospects that financial success with TPS requires commitment, effort, and sales skill. Conversely, Business Associates must never represent that one can be successful without selling products and services and diligently applying themselves.   Examples of misrepresentations in this area include:<br><br>

•“All In” Mentality – okay to encourage someone to go “All---In” for educational purposes and for help in building his or her business. However, behaviors that are not permitted: “Get All---In sit back and make money,” “Go into debt,” “forego paying your rent,” “sell your car,” “do it  or  you’ll  be removed from the team,” “threats,” “bashing,” “name calling,” or “alienation” in any manner;<br>
•Do nothing and get paid, as the system will do the work for you;<br>
•Just get in and your downline will build through spillover;<br>
•Just join and I’ll build your downline for you;<br>
•The Company does all the work for you;<br>
•You don’t have to sell anything; or<br>
•All you have to do is buy your products or services every month.<br><br>

The above are just some examples of improper and prohibited statements about the Company and the Compensation Plan. It is important that  Business Associates  do  not  make  these  or  any  other  representations  that could lead a prospect to believe that he or she can be successful as an TPS Business Associate without commitment, effort, and sales skill.

<h5>3.6.4 Income Disclosure Statement</h5>
The TPS Income Disclosure Statement (“IDS”) is designed to convey truthful, timely, and comprehensive information regarding the income that TPS Business Associates earn. In order to accomplish this objective, a copy of the IDS must be presented to a prospective Business Associate (someone who is not a party to a current TPS Business Associate Agreement) anytime the Compensation Plan is presented or discussed, or any type of income claim or earnings representation is made.<br><br>

The terms “income claim”  and/or “earnings representation” (collectively  “income claim”) include: (a) statements of actual earnings, (b) statements of projected earnings, (c) statements of earnings ranges, (d) income testimonials, (e) lifestyle claims and (f) hypothetical claims.<br><br>

A lifestyle income claim typically includes statements (or pictures) involving large homes, luxury cars, exotic vacations, or other items suggesting or implying wealth. They also consist of references to the achievement of one's dreams, having everything one always wanted, and are phrased in terms of “opportunity” or “possibility” or “chance.” Claims such as “My  The Perfect Solution  income  exceeded  my salary after six months in the business,” or “Our TPS business has allowed my wife to come home and be a full---time mom” also fall within the purview of “lifestyle” claims.<br><br>

In any non---public meeting (e.g., a home meeting, one---on---one, regardless of venue) with a prospective Business Associate or Business Associates in which the Compensation Plan is discussed or any type of income claim is made, Business Associates must provide the prospect(s) with a copy of the IDS. In any meeting that is open to the public in which the Compensation Plan is discussed or any type of income claims expressly approved in writing by the Company is made, Business Associates must provide every prospective Business Associate with a copy of the IDS.  In any meeting in which any type of video display is utilized (e.g., monitor, television, projector, etc.) a slide of the IDS must be displayed continuously throughout the duration of any discussion of the Compensation Plan or the making of an income claim.<br><br>

Copies of the IDS may be printed or downloaded without charge from the Business Associate Back Office.<br><br>

Business Associates who develop sales aids and tools in which the Compensation Plan or income claims  are present must incorporate the IDS into each such sales aid or tool prior to distribution  to  prospective Business Associates.

<h5>3.6.5  Tradeshows, Exhibitions and other Sales Forums</h5>
Business Associates may display and/or sell TPS products or services at trade shows and professional expositions, provided the provisions of Section 3.2.2 are adhered to.

<h4>3.7 Conflicts of Interest SECTION </h4>
<h5>3.7.1 Non---Solicitation</h5>
TPS Business Associates are free to participate in other MLM, multilevel, network  marketing, or Internet Marketing business ventures or marketing opportunities (collectively, “network marketing”) there are  conditions to adhere to when promoting those other ventures.  However, such Business Associates agree that they shall not directly or indirectly recruit other TPS Business Associates or Customers for any other network marketing businesses. This provision shall be enforceable during the term of this Agreement and for twelve (12) months thereafter, regardless if cancellation was voluntary or involuntary.<br>
The term “recruit” includes the actual or attempted sponsorship, solicitation, enrollment, encouragement, or effort of influence in any other way a Business Associate or Customer to enroll or participate in another multilevel marketing, network marketing  or  direct  sales  opportunity.   The term also  includes

general solicitation on your social networking site where your “friends” include persons  not  personally enrolled by you and who are TPS Business Associates. It also includes merely mentioning your participating in another Network Marketing business.<br>
TPS Business Associates are not restricted from selling the services and products of other companies. However, direct or indirect promotion of those products and services to TPS Business Associates or customers is strictly prohibited.<br>
If after a full investigation it is confirmed that a Business Associate has violated this provision, he or she will be suspended without compensation for 1 month. If after that, the behavior continues, TPS will terminate the position.


<h5>3.7.2 Cross---Sponsoring</h5>
“Cross sponsoring” is defined as the enrollment into a different line of sponsorship of an individual, or business entity, that already has a signed Agreement with TPS. Actual or attempted cross sponsoring is not allowed. If cross sponsoring is verified by TPS, sanctions up to  and including termination of a Business Associate’s distributorship may be imposed.

<h5>3.7.3 Business Associate Participation in Other Programs</h5>
While TPS Business Associates are free to participate in other Business Associate, multilevel or network marketing business ventures or marketing opportunities (collectively, “network marketing”) there are conditions to adhere to when promoting those other ventures. If a Business Associate is engaged in other non--- TPS programs, it is the responsibility of the Business Associate to ensure that  his  or  her  TPS business is operated entirely separate and apart from any other program. To this end,  the following must be adhered to:<br><br>

•Business Associates may not use the TPS system, services, or back office to send communications regarding a non---TPS business or opportunity;<br>
•Business Associates shall not display TPS promotional materials, sales aids, products or services with or in the same location as any non---TPS promotional materials, sales aids, products or services.<br>

•Business Associate may not offer any non---TPS opportunity, products, services or opportunity at any TPS---related meeting, seminar, convention, webinar, teleconference, or other function.

<h5>3.7.4 Confidential Information</h5>
 “Confidential Information” includes, but not limited to, (whether in oral, written or electronic form) Customer and Business Associate lists, contact information of TPS Customers and Business Associates, and Business Associates’ personal and downline sales information, trade secrets, manufacturer and supplier information, business reports, commission or sales reports and such other financial and business information which the Company deems as confidential. Confidential Information is, or may be available, to Business Associates in their respective back offices. Business Associate access to such Confidential Information is password protected, is confidential, and constitutes proprietary information and business trade secrets belonging to TPS. Such Confidential Information is provided to Business Associates in strictest  confidence  and  is  made available to Business Associates for the sole purpose of assisting Business Associates in working with their respective Marketing Organizations  in  the  development  of  their  The Perfect Solution  business.   Business Associates must use  their  best

efforts to keep such confidential information confidential. Business Associates may not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than for developing their independent TPS businesses. When a Business Associate participates in other direct selling or multilevel marketing ventures, the Business Associate may not use the Confidential Information, including, but not limited to, Customer or Business Associate lists. Business Associates should use the Confidential Information to assist, motivate, and train their downline Business Associates and in connection with the sale of the Company’s products and services, and for no other purpose. In so doing, a Business Associate may not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, including, without limitation, his or her downline Business Associates.<br>
Upon nonrenewal or termination of the Agreement, Business Associates must immediately discontinue all use of the Confidential Information and if requested by the Company promptly return all materials in their possession to the Company within five business days of request at their own expense.<br><br>

To protect the Confidential Information, a Business Associate shall not, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of any other person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity:<br><br>

(i)Directly or indirectly disclose any Confidential Information to any third party;<br>
(ii)Directly or indirectly disclose the password or other access code to his or her back---office;<br>
(iii)Use any Confidential Information to compete with TPS or for any purpose other than promoting his or her TPS business; or<br>
(iv)Recruit or solicit any Business Associate or Customer of TPS listed on any report or in  the Business Associate’s back office, or in any manner attempt to influence or induce any Business Associate or Customer of TPS, to alter their business relationship with TPS.<br><br>

The obligation of a Business Associate to not disclose any Confidential Information shall survive expiration or termination of the Agreement.

<h4>3.8 Recruiting and Soliciting Other Direct Sellers</h4>
When recruiting or soliciting participants in other direct selling ventures to either purchase TPS services or to participate  in  The Perfect Solution  opportunity,  Business Associates  must  not  encourage such persons to terminate or violate any term or condition of any agreements that they may have with other direct selling companies. Should a Business Associate engage in such activity, the Business Associate bears the risk of being sued by the other direct sales company. If any lawsuit, arbitration or mediation is brought against a Business Associate alleging that he or she engaged in inappropriate recruiting activity of its sales force or Customers, TPS will not pay any of the Business Associate’s defense costs or legal fees, nor will TPS indemnify the Business Associate for any judgment, award, or settlement.
<h4>3.9 Errors or Questions</h4>
If a Business Associate has questions about or believes any errors have been made  regarding  commissions, bonuses, downline activity reports, genealogy lists, or charges, the Business Associate must notify TPS in writing within 60 days of the date of the purported error or incident in question. TPS will not be responsible for any errors, omissions or problems not reported to the Company within 60 days.
<h4>3.10 Governmental Approval or Endorsement</h4>
Neither federal nor state regulatory agencies or officials approve or endorse any  direct  selling  or network marketing companies or programs. Therefore, Business Associates shall not represent or imply  that TPS or its Compensation Plan have been 'approved,' 'endorsed' or otherwise sanctioned by any government agency.

<h4>3.11 Income Taxes</h4>
Each Business Associate is responsible for paying all local, state, and federal taxes on any income generated as a Business Associate. If a Business Associate’s TPS business is tax exempt, the Federal tax identification number must be provided to TPS. Every year, TPS will provide an IRS Form 1099 MISC (Non---employee Compensation) earnings statement to each U.S. resident who: 1) Had earnings of over $600 in the previous calendar year; or 2) Made purchases during the previous calendar year in excess of $5,000, or as otherwise required by law.<br><br>

TPS cannot provide Business Associates with any personal tax advice. Business Associates should consult with their own tax accountant, tax attorney, or other tax professional.

<h4>3.12  Independent Contractor Status</h4>
Business Associates are independent contractors. The Agreement between TPS138 and its Business Associates does not create an employer/employee relationship, agency, partnership, or joint venture between the Company and the Business Associate. Business Associates shall not be treated as an  employee  for  his  or  her  services  or  for Federal or state tax purposes. All Business Associates are responsible for paying local, state, and federal taxes due from all compensation earned as a Business Associate of the Company. TPS is not responsible for withholding, and shall not withhold or deduct from a Representative’s bonuses and commissions, if any, FICA or taxes of any kind, unless withholding becomes legally required. Business Associates have no authority (expressed or implied), to bind the Company to any obligation. Business Associates are not authorized to and will not incur any debt, expense, obligation, or open any checking account or credit card on behalf of, for, or in the name of TPS. Each Business Associate shall establish his or her own goals, hours, and methods of sale, so long as he or she complies with the terms of the Business Associate Agreement, these Policies and Procedures, and applicable laws. Each Business Associate shall be solely responsible for paying all expenses incurred, including but not limited to travel, food, lodging, secretarial, office, long distance telephone, and other expenses.
<h4>3.13 International Marketing</h4>
Business Associates are authorized to sell TPS products and services and to enroll Business Associates only in the countries in which TPS is authorized to conduct business, as announced in  official Company literature. In addition, no Business Associate may, in any unauthorized country: (a) conduct sales, enrollment or training meetings; (b) enroll or attempt to enroll potential Customers  or  Business Associates;  or  (c) conduct any other activity for the purpose of sponsoring the sale of The Perfect Solution  products  or services, establishing a Marketing Organization, or promoting the TPS opportunity.

<h4>3.14 Enrollment and Bonus Buying Restrictions</h4>
Each Business Associate must directly join the Company and purchase products and services on his or her own volition. As a result, the following activities are strictly prohibited for any reason including “bonus buying.” Business Associates are prohibited from: (a) the enrollment of individuals or entities without the knowledge of and/or execution of an Independent Business Associate  Agreement  by  such  individuals  or  entities  including,   without limitation, through co---ops; (b) the fraudulent enrollment of an individual or entity as a Business Associate or Customer; (c) the enrollment or attempted enrollment of nonexistent individuals or entities as Business Associate or Customers (“phantoms”); (d) the use of a credit card by or on behalf of a Business Associate or Customer when the Business Associate or Customer is not the account holder of such credit card; (3) the purchasing of products, services or other items on behalf of another Business Associate or Customer or under another Business Associate ’s or Customer’s I.D. number for any purpose including,  without  limitation,  to  qualify  for  commissions  or  bonuses.  Business Associates agree that they shall not purchase TPS products or services for the sole purpose of qualifying for compensation under the Compensation Plan. Nor shall any Business Associate influence or attempt to influence any other Business Associate to do the same. Bonus buying also includes any mechanism or artifice to qualify for rank advancement, incentives, prizes, commissions or bonuses that is not driven by bona fide product or service

purchases by end user consumers.

<h4>3.15 Adherence to Laws and Ordinances</h4>
Business Associates shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the conduct of their businesses. Many cities and counties have laws regulating certain home---based businesses. Business Associates must obey those laws that do apply to them.  If a city or county official tells a Business Associate that an ordinance applies to him or her, the Business Associate shall be polite and cooperative and consult the appropriate legal advisor as to its applicability and compliance.

<h4>3.16 One TPS Business Per Business Associate and Three Per Household</h4>
A Business Associate may operate or have an ownership interest, legal or equitable, as a sole proprietorship, partner, shareholder, trustee, or beneficiary, in only one TPS business. No individual may have, operate or receive compensation from more than one TPS business.<br><br>

In order to maintain the integrity of the TPS Compensation Plan, each household is allowed to own and operate 3 TPS business stores.<br><br>

A “Household” is defined as all individuals who are living at or doing business at the same address, and who are related by blood, marriage, domestic partnership, or adoption, or who are living together as a family unit or in a family---like setting.<br><br>

An exception to the one business per Business Associate/Household rule will be considered on a case---by---case basis if two Business Associates get married or move in together, or in cases of a Business Associate receiving an interest in another business through inheritance. Requests for exceptions to policy must be submitted in writing to the  Legal  Department  (legal@tps138.com).

<h4>3.17 Actions of Household Members or Business Associated Parties</h4>
If any member of a Business Associate’s immediate Household engages in any activity, which, if performed by the Business Associate, would violate any provision of the Agreement, such activity will be  deemed  a  violation  by  the Business Associate, and TPS may take disciplinary action pursuant  to  these  Policies  and  Procedures against the Business Associate. Similarly, if any individual associated  in  any  way  with  a  corporation,  partnership, limited liability company, trust or other legal entity (a “Business Entity”) violates the  Agreement,  such action(s) will be deemed a violation by the Business Entity, and TPS may take disciplinary action against the Business Entity. Likewise, if a Business Associate enrolls in TPS as a Business Entity, each Business Associated Party (as defined in Section 3.17.1) of the Business Entity shall be personally and individually bound to, and must comply with, the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

<h5>3.17.1 Business Entities</h5>
A Business Entity may apply to be a TPS Business Associate by submitting a Business Associate Application and Agreement along with a properly completed Business Entity Registration form and a properly completed IRS Form W---9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number). If a Business Associate enrolls online, the Business Entity Registration Form must be submitted to  TPS within 30 days of the online enrollment. (If not received within the 30---day period, the Business Associate Agreement shall automatically terminate.)  An  The Perfect Solution  business  may  change  its  status  under  the  same  Sponsor  from  an

individual to a Business Entity. There is a $25.00 fee for each change requested, which must be included with the written request and the  completed  Business Associate  Agreement.  The  Business  Entity  Registration  form must be signed by all of the owners, shareholders, members, partners or trustees. The Business Entity and its owners, shareholders, members, managers, partners, trustees, or other parties with  any  ownership interest in, or management responsibilities for, the Business Entity (collectively “Business Associated Parties”) are individually, jointly and severally liable for  any indebtedness  to TPS, compliance with the TPS Policies and  Procedures, compliance  with  the  TPS  Business Associate  Agreement, and all  other  obligations to TPS. The Perfect Solution will  recognize only one  individual  in regard to any benefits received based on account performance. Be sure to indicate who shall receive said benefits (should any occur) when completing the Business Entity Registration Form. If no  one  is  listed, TPS will deem it to be the first person listed on the form.

<h4>3.18  Sale, Transfer or Assignment of an Independent TPS Business</h4>
Although an TPS business is an independently operated business, the sale, transfer or assignment of an TPS business is subject to certain limitations.  If a Business Associate wishes to sell his or her TPS business, the selling Business Associate must offer TPS the right of first refusal to purchase the business on the same terms as agreed upon with a third---party buyer. TPS shall have 15 days from the date of receipt of the written offer from the Business Associate to exercise its right of first refusal.  If TPS elects not to purchase the business, the following criteria must be met:<br><br>

•The selling Business Associate must submit a $250 transfer fee to the Company to reimburse it for its expenses associated with the transaction.<br>
•TPS must approve the buyer or transferee prior to finalization of the purchase.<br>
•The buyer or transferee must become a qualified TPS Business Associate. If the buyer is an active TPS Business Associate, he or she must first terminate his or her TPS business and wait six calendar months before acquiring any interest in a different  TPS  business.<br>
•Before the sale, transfer or assignment can be finalized and approved by TPS, any debt obligations the selling Business Associate has with TPS must be satisfied.<br>
•The selling Business Associate must be in good standing and not in violation of any of the terms of the Agreement in order to be eligible to sell, transfer or assign an TPS business.<br><br>

Prior to selling an independent TPS business or interest in a Business Associate who is a Business Entity, the selling Business Associate must notify TPS’s Compliance Department in writing and advise of his or her intent to sell his or her The Perfect Solution  business  or  Business  Entity  interest.  The  selling Business Associate must receive written approval from TPS before proceeding with the  sale.  No changes in line of sponsorship can result from the sale or transfer of an TPS business.<br><br>

The selling Business Associate agrees that he or she will not disparage, demean or otherwise criticize TPS, either written or verbal, after the sale or transfer of his or  her  The Perfect Solution  business. Business Associates agree that it would be impossible, impractical, or extremely difficult to  fix  the  actual  damages suffered by reason of such a violation. Therefore, if such a breach does occur, Business Associates hereby agree that TPS may recover damages incurred, without prejudice to TPS’s right to also seek injunctive or other equitable relief.


<h5>3.18.1 Financing Prohibited</h5>
TPS LLC does not permit the use of any financing options or terms by a Business Associate to his or her team or prospects. This includes, but is not limited to: Business Associate membership and product or service

purchases.  All  purchases  are  to  be  made  through  the  TPS138   site   and   by   no   other means. Violation of this policy may include suspension or termination of the Business Associate's Agreement Network account.


<h5>3.18.2 General</h5>
Each Business Associate must immediately notify TPS of all changes to the information contained on his or her Business Associate Agreement or Business Entity Registration Form. Business Associates may Edit their existing Business Associate Agreement (i.e., change Social Security number to Federal I.D. number, or change the form of ownership from an individual proprietorship to a Business Entity owned by the Business Associate) by submitting a written request, a properly executed Business Associate Agreement, and appropriate supporting documentation. Changes shall be processed only once per year. All changes must be submitted by November 30 to become effective on January 1 of the following year.


<h4>3.19 Separation of an TPS Business</h4>
PS Business Associates sometimes operate their TPS businesses  as  a  Business Entity. At such time as a marriage may end in divorce or a Business Entity may dissolve, arrangements must be made to assure that any separation or division of the business is accomplished so as not to adversely affect the interests and income of other businesses up or down the line of sponsorship.<br><br>

During the divorce or Business Entity dissolution process, the parties must adopt one of the following methods of operation:<br><br>

One of the parties may, with consent of the other(s), operate the TPS  business pursuant to an assignment in writing whereby the relinquishing spouse or owner in the Business Entity authorizes TPS to deal directly and solely with the other spouse or owner(s).<br><br>

The parties may continue to operate the TPS business jointly on a “business---as--- usual” basis, whereupon all compensation paid by TPS will be paid according to the status quo as it existed prior to the divorce filing or dissolution proceedings. This is the default procedure if the parties do not agree on the format set forth above.<br><br>

Under no circumstances will the Marketing Organization of divorcing spouses or a dissolving Business Entity be divided. TPS will recognize only one Marketing Organization. In the event that parties to a divorce or dissolution proceeding are unable to resolve a dispute over the disposition of commissions and ownership of the business in a timely fashion as determined by the Company, the Business Associate Agreement shall be involuntarily canceled.<br>
<br>
If a former spouse or owner in the Business Entity has completely relinquished all rights in the original TPS business pursuant to a divorce or Business Entity dissolution, he or she is thereafter free to enroll under any Sponsor of his or her choosing without waiting six calendar months. In such event, the former spouse shall have no rights to any Business Associates in his or her former Marketing Organization or to any former Customer. He or she must develop the new business in the same manner, as would any other new Business Associate.


<h4>3.20 Sponsoring Online</h4>
When sponsoring  a new Business Associate through the  online enrollment process, the Sponsor may assist the new applicant in filling out the enrollment materials. However, the applicant must personally review and agree to the Business Associate Agreement.  The Sponsor may not fill out or submit the Business Associate Agreement on behalf of the applicant.

<h4>3.21 Death or Incapacity of a Business Associate</h4>
The Business Associate Agreement is a contract for personal services. Upon the death or incapacitation (as determined in the Company’s sole discretion) of a Business Associate, the Business Associate Agreement shall require  the following actions.<br><br>

To effect a testamentary transfer of an TPS business, the executor of the estate must provide the  following to TPS: (a) an original death certificate; (b) certified  letters testamentary or a letter of administration appointing an executor; and (c) written instructions from the authorized executor to TPS specifying to whom the business and income should be transferred.<br><br>

To effect a transfer of a TPS business because of incapacity, the successor must provide the following to TPS:  (a) a notarized copy of an appointment as trustee; (b) a notarized copy of the trust document or other documentation establishing the trustee’s right to administer the TPS business; and (c) a completed Business Associate Agreement executed by the trustee.


<h4>3.22 Telemarketing Techniques</h4>
Each country has its own laws and regulations  that restrict telemarketing practices. For example, FTC, a Federal Agency of USA has “do not call” regulations as part of their telemarketing laws.  Although TPS does not consider Business Associates to be “telemarketers” in the traditional sense of the word, these government regulations broadly define the term “telemarketer” and “telemarketing” so that a Business Associate’s action of calling someone whose telephone number is listed on the federal “do not call” registry could cause the Business Associate to violate the law. Moreover, these regulations must not be taken lightly, as they carry significant penalties.<br><br>

Therefore, Business Associates must not engage in telemarketing in the operation of their TPS businesses. The term “telemarketing” includes but is not limited to the placing of one or more telephone calls to an individual or entity to induce the purchase of a TPS service, or to recruit them for the TPS opportunity. 'Cold calls' made to prospective Customers or  Business Associates  that promote either TPS’s products or services or the TPS opportunity could constitute telemarketing and are prohibited.<br><br>

Under certain circumstances, if the Business Associate has an established business relationship with the prospect, a call may be permitted. It is the responsibility of the Business Associate to understand and comply with these laws and determine when calls are permitted.<br><br>

Business Associates shall not use automatic telephone dialing systems  or  software  relative  to  the  operation  of their TPS businesses. Business Associates shall not place or initiate any outbound telephone call to any person that delivers any pre---recorded message or “robocall” regarding or relating to the TPS products, services or opportunity.


<h4>3.23 Back  Office  Access</h4>
TPS makes online back offices available to its Business Associates. This back office is Confidential Information that may be used solely and exclusively to promote the development of a Business Associate’s TPS business and to increase sales of TPS products and services. However, access to a back office is a privilege, and not a right. TPS reserves the right to deny Business Associates’ access to the back offices at its sole discretion.   The information contained in the back office must never be publicly

disclosed  due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  the  confidential  information.    This  includes  screenshots  or  any derivatives of the information.<br><br>

If a Business Associate gives his or her API key to another Business Associate or via a signup process, it may not be shared or sold for any reason by the Business Associate obtained the information. If Business Associate is found to be in breach of this policy, the Business Associate’s account will be immediately suspended and the Business Associate may be terminated.


<h4>3.24 Change of Contact Information</h4>
To ensure timely delivery of products, services, support materials, commissions and tax documents, it is important that TPS’s files of personal record are current. Business Associates planning to change any of their contact information or move must update their contact information via the back office function of the TPS website. To guarantee proper delivery of goods, two weeks advance notice must be provided to TPS on all changes.

<h4>3.25 Continuing Development Obligations </h4>
<h5>3.25.1 Ongoing Training</h5>
Any Business Associate who sponsors another Business Associate into TPS must perform a bona fide assistance and training function to ensure that his or her Marketing Organization is properly operating his or her TPS business. Business Associates must have ongoing contact and communication  with  the Business Associates in their Marketing Organizations. Examples of such contact and communication may include, but are not limited to: newsletters, written correspondence, personal meetings, telephone contact, voice mail, electronic mail, and the accompaniment of new Business Associates to local TPS meetings, training sessions, and other functions. Leaders of new Business Associates are also responsible to motivate and train new Business Associates in TPS product and service knowledge, effective sales techniques, the TPS Compensation  Plan,  and  compliance  with  Company’s  Policies  and  Procedures.  Communication  with  and the training of new Business Associates must not, however, violate Sections 3.1 and/or 3.2 (regarding the development of Business Associate---produced sales aids and promotional materials).<br><br>

Business Associates should monitor the Business Associates in their Marketing Organizations to guard against new Business Associates making improper product, earnings or business claims or engaging in any illegal or inappropriate conduct.


<h5>3.25.2 Increased  Training  Responsibilities</h5>
As Business Associates progress through the various levels of leadership, they will become more experienced in sales techniques, product and service knowledge and understanding  of  the  TPS program. They may be called upon to share this knowledge with lesser---experienced Business Associates within their Marketing Organization.

<h5>3.25.3 Ongoing Sales Responsibilities</h5>
Regardless  of  their  level  of  achievement,  Business Associates  have  an  ongoing  obligation  to  continue  to  personally promote sales through the generation of new Customers and through servicing their existing Customers.

<h4>3.26 Non-disparagement</h4>
TPS values constructive criticisms and comments from Business Associates.  All such  comments should be submitted in writing to the Legal Department (legal@tps138.com). While TPS welcomes constructive input, negative comments and remarks made  in  the  field  by  Business Associates about the Company, its products, or Compensation Plan serve no purpose other than to sour the enthusiasm of other TPS Business Associates. For this reason, and to set the proper example for their Marketing Organizations, Business Associates must not disparage, demean, or make negative remarks about The TPS,
Other TPS Business Associates, TPS’s products or services, the Compensation Plan or TPS’s directors, officers, or employees.


<h4>3.27 Product Sales and Commissions</h4>
he TPS Compensation Plan is based on the sale of the TPS products and services to end consumers. Business Associates must fulfill personal sales requirements as specified in the TPS Compensation Plan (as well as meet other responsibilities set  forth  in  the  Agreement)  to  be eligible to earn commissions from  the  sale  of  the  The TPS  products  and  services.   All commissions are paid directly to eligible Business Associates through the payment processing  accounts  that  each Business Associate must activate.

<h4>3.28 Refunds</h4>
Except as otherwise set forth in the Agreement, due to the nature of TPS’s online business, certain products are available at the time of purchase. As such, TPS has a strict 14-day (domestic) or 30-day (international) return policy in effect, which begins from the date of purchase.<br><br>

Business Associates receive commissions based on the actual sales of the products and services to end consumers. When the Company issues a refund to a Customer, the Business Associate who received a commission based on the sale of the refunded product or service agrees that he or she shall  reimburse  TPS  the amount of the refund.  The amount of such refund may be offset against future commissions to the Business Associate at the Company’s sole discretion.

<h4>3.29 Reports</h4>
All information provided by TPS in team activity or team genealogy reports, including but not limited to, team sales information and team sponsoring activity is believed to be accurate and reliable. Nevertheless, due to various factors, including but not limited to, the  inherent possibility of human, digital and mechanical error, the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of orders, denial of credit card and electronic check payments, returned products, credit card and electronic check charge---backs, the information is not guaranteed by TPS or any persons creating or transmitting the information to be accurate.<br><br>

ALL PERSONAL AND TEAM SALES INFORMATION IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER. IN PARTICULAR BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION THERE SHALL BE NO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.<br><br>

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, TPS AND/OR OTHER PERSONS CREATING OR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION WILL IN NO EVENT BE LIABLE TO ANY BUSINESS ASSOCIATE OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES THAT ARISE OUT OF THE USE OF OR ACCESS TO PERSONAL AND/OR DOWNLINE SALES INFORMATION (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, COMMISSIONS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, AND DAMAGES THAT MAY RESULT FROM  INACCURACY,  INCOMPLETENESS,  INCONVENIENCE,  DELAY,  OR LOSS OF THE USE OF THE INFORMATION), EVEN IF TPS OR OTHER PERSONS CREATING OR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION SHALL HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TPS OR OTHER PERSONS CREATING OR TRANSMITTING THE INFORMATION SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE UNDER ANY TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY,  PRODUCTS  LIABILITY  OR  OTHER  THEORY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO.<br><br>

Access to and use of TPS’s online reporting services and a Business Associate’s reliance upon such information is at his or her own risk. All such information is provided to Business Associates 'as is'. If a Business Associate is dissatisfied with the accuracy or quality of the information, his or her sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue use of and access to TPS’s online reporting services and his or her reliance upon the information.


<h4>3.30 Product Claims/Representations</h4>
Business Associates must be truthful in the representation of the Company’s products and services. Business Associates may make no claim, representation or warranty concerning any product or service of the Company, except those expressly approved in writing by the Company or contained in Company materials.


<h4>3.31 Product/Service Warranty Disclaimer</h4>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY MADE BY THE COMPANY IN WRITING, THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANSHIP, NON---INFRINGEMENT OR ANY OTHER WARRANTY ARISING BY LAW, STATUTE, USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING CONCERNING ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PURCHASED FROM OR THROUGH THE COMPANY.

<h4>3.32 Monthly Billing</h4>
The monthly subscription fees are automatically paid each month with a credit or debit card maintained on file with TPS, or from a business associate’s monthly fee pool . Business Associates may make adjustments to their monthly subscription in the back office of the TPS website at any time.<br><br>

Account lockdown or suspension occurs when TPS is unable to process a payment for the Business Associate fee within 7 days pass its monthly due date. There is a 90 day grace period for the business associate to pay his or her monthly past dues so his or her account before that account is permanently terminated.


<h4>3.33 Privacy</h4>
